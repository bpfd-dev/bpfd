# Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Local Host

This section describes running bpfd and the example eBPF programs on a local host.
When running bpfd, it can be run as a process or run as a systemd service.
Examples run the same, independent of how bpfd is deployed, other than requiring `sudo` or not.

> **_NOTE:_** When running bpfd as a systemd service, bpfd can only access files owned by the `bpfd`
user, which is created by the install script (`./script/setup.sh install`).
In this case, the install script also copies the examples eBPF bytecode from the examples directory to a
directory owned by bpfd (`/run/bpfd/examples/`).
When bpfd is run as a privileged process, the bytecode can be loaded from the examples directory.
The example code looks in both locations (`/run/bpfd/examples/` first), so if the bytecode is recompiled
and bpfd is running as a systemd service, run `./script/setup.sh examples` to update the copied version.

### Building

To build directly on a system, make sure all the prerequisites are met, then build.

#### Prerequisites

*This assumes bpfd is already installed and running on the system.
If not, see [Setup and Building bpfd](./building-bpfd.md).*

1. All [requirements defined by the `cilium/ebpf` package](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf#requirements)
2. libbpf development package to get the required eBPF c headers

    Fedora:

    `sudo dnf install libbpf-devel`

    Ubuntu:

    `sudo apt-get install libbpf-dev`

3. Cilium's `bpf2go` binary

    `go install github.com/cilium/ebpf/cmd/bpf2go@master`

#### Building Locally

To build all the C based eBPF counter bytecode, run:

```console
cd bpfd/examples/
make generate
```

To build all the Userspace GO Client examples, run:

```console
cd bpfd/examples/
make build
```

To build only a single example:

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tc-counter/
go generate
go build
```

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/
go generate
go build
```
```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-xdp-counter/
go generate
go build
```

### Running On Host

The most basic way to deploy this example is running directly on a host system.
First, start or ensure `bpfd` is up and running.
[Tutorial](./tutorial.md) will guide you through deploying `bpfd`.
In all the examples of running on a host system, a bpfd-client certificate is used
that is generated by `bpfd` to encrypt the application's connection to `bpfd`.
The diagram below shows `go-xdp-counter` example, but the `go-tc-counter` and
`go-tracepoint-counter` examples operate exactly the same way.

![go-xdp-counter On Host](../img/gocounter-on-host.png)

Following the diagram (Purple numbers):

1. When `go-xdp-counter` userspace is started, it will send a gRPC request
over mTLS to `bpfd` requesting `bpfd` to load the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode located on disk
at `bpfd/examples/go-xdp-counter/bpf_bpfel.o` at a priority of 50 and on interface `ens3`.
These values are configurable as we will see later, but for now we will use the defaults
(except interface, which is required to be entered).
2. `bpfd` will load it's `dispatcher` eBPF program, which links to the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF program
and return a UUID referencing the running program.
3. `bpfctl list` can be used to show that the eBPF program was loaded.
4. Once the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode is loaded, the eBPF program will write packet counts
and byte counts to a shared map.
5. `go-xdp-counter` userspace program periodically reads counters from the shared map and logs
the value.

#### Running Privileged

The most basic example, just use `sudo` to start the `go-xdp-counter` program.
Determine the host interface to attach the eBPF program to and then start the go program with:

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-xdp-counter/
sudo ./go-xdp-counter -iface <INTERNET INTERFACE NAME>
```

or (**NOTE:** TC programs also require a direction, ingress or egress)

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tc-counter/
sudo ./go-tc-counter -direction ingress -iface <INTERNET INTERFACE NAME>
```

or

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/
sudo ./go-tracepoint-counter
```

The output should show the count and total bytes of packets as they pass through the
interface as shown below:

```console
sudo ./go-xdp-counter --iface vethff657c7
2023/07/17 17:43:58 Using Input: Interface=vethff657c7 Priority=50 Source=/run/bpfd/examples/go-xdp-counter/bpf_bpfel.o
2023/07/17 17:43:58 Unable to read /etc/bpfd/bpfd.toml, using default configuration values.
2023/07/17 17:43:58 Program registered with id 6211
2023/07/17 17:44:01 4 packets received
2023/07/17 17:44:01 580 bytes received

2023/07/17 17:44:04 4 packets received
2023/07/17 17:44:04 580 bytes received

2023/07/17 17:44:07 8 packets received
2023/07/17 17:44:07 1160 bytes received

:
```

Use `bpfctl` to show the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode was loaded.

```console
bpfctl list
 Program ID  Name       Type  Load Time
 6211        xdp_stats  xdp   2023-07-17T17:43:58-0400
```

Finally, press `<CTRL>+c` when finished with `go-xdp-counter`.

```console
:

2023/07/17 17:44:34 28 packets received
2023/07/17 17:44:34 4060 bytes received

^C2023/07/17 17:44:35 Exiting...
2023/07/17 17:44:35 Unloading Program: 6211
```

#### Running Unprivileged

To run the examples unprivileged (without `sudo`), the following three steps must be performed.

##### Step 1: Create `bpfd` User Group

The [Tutorial](./tutorial.md) guide describes the different modes `bpfd` can be run in.
Specifically, the [Systemd Service](./tutorial.md#systemd-service) section explains how to
start `bpfd` and create the `bpfd` Users and `bpfd` User Group.
`bpfd` must be started as a Systemd Service and the examples must be run from a User that is a
member of the `bpfd` User Group.

```console
sudo usermod -a -G bpfd $USER
exit
<LOGIN>
```

If the user running the userspace program is not a member of the `bpfd` user group, then the userspace
program cannot access the map files shared between the BFP program and the userspace program.
If the above step is skipped, then the userspace program must be run with `sudo` or the program must
be granted CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capabilities (`sudo /sbin/setcap cap_dac_override=ep ./go-xdp-counter`).

##### Step 2: Grant CAP_BPF Linux Capability

> **_NOTE:_** Only for kernel versions prior to **kernel 5.19**

The examples use a map to share data between the userspace side of the program and the eBPF portion.
Accessing this map requires access to the CAP_BPF capability for kernel versions prior to **kernel 5.19**.
Run the following command to grant `go-xdp-counter` access to the CAP_BPF capability:

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-xdp-counter/
sudo /sbin/setcap cap_bpf=ep ./go-xdp-counter
```

and

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tc-counter/
sudo /sbin/setcap cap_bpf=ep ./go-tc-counter
```

and

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/
sudo /sbin/setcap cap_bpf=ep ./go-tracepoint-counter
```

> **_Reminder:_** The capability must be re-granted each time the examples are rebuilt.

##### Step 3: Start `go-xdp-counter` without `sudo`

Start `go-xdp-counter` without `sudo`:

```console
./go-xdp-counter -iface ens3
2022/12/02 15:59:34 Unable to read /etc/bpfd/bpfd.toml, using default configuration values.

2022/12/02 15:59:41 4 packets received
2022/12/02 15:59:41 580 bytes received

:

```

### Passing eBPF Bytecode In A Container Image

bpfd can load eBPF bytecode from a container image built following the spec described in
[eBPF Bytecode Image Specifications](../developer-guide/shipping-bytecode.md).
Pre-built eBPF container images for the examples can be loaded from:

* `quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-xdp-counter:latest`
* `quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-tc-counter:latest`
* `quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-tracepoint-counter:latest`

To use the container image, pass the URL to the userspace program:

```console
./go-xdp-counter -iface ens3 -image quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-xdp-counter:latest
2022/12/02 16:28:32 Unable to read /etc/bpfd/bpfd.toml, using default configuration values.
2022/12/02 16:28:32 Using Input: Interface=ens3 Priority=50 Source=quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-xdp-counter:latest
2022/12/02 16:28:34 Program registered with id 6223

2022/12/02 16:28:40 4 packets received

^C2022/12/02 16:28:42 Exiting...
2022/12/02 16:28:42 Unloading Program: 6223
```

#### Building eBPF Bytecode Container Image

[eBPF Bytecode Image Specifications](../developer-guide/shipping-bytecode.md) provides detailed
instructions on building and shipping bytecode in a container image.
To build `go-xdp-counter` and `go-tc-counter` eBPF bytecode container image, first make sure the
bytecode has been built (i.e. `bpf_bpfel.o` has been built - see [Building](#building])), then
run the build commands below:

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-xdp-counter/
go generate

docker build \
  --build-arg PROGRAM_NAME=go-xdp-counter \
  --build-arg BPF_FUNCTION_NAME=xdp_stats \
  --build-arg PROGRAM_TYPE=xdp \
  --build-arg BYTECODE_FILENAME=bpf_bpfel.o \
  --build-arg KERNEL_COMPILE_VER=$(uname -r) \
  -f ../../packaging/container-deployment/Containerfile.bytecode . -t quay.io/$USER/go-xdp-counter-bytecode:latest
```

and

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tc-counter/
go generate

docker build \
  --build-arg PROGRAM_NAME=go-tc-counter \
  --build-arg BPF_FUNCTION_NAME=stats \
  --build-arg PROGRAM_TYPE=tc \
  --build-arg BYTECODE_FILENAME=bpf_bpfel.o \
  --build-arg KERNEL_COMPILE_VER=$(uname -r) \
  -f ../../packaging/container-deployment/Containerfile.bytecode . -t quay.io/$USER/go-tc-counter-bytecode:latest
```

and

```console
cd bpfd/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/
go generate

docker build \
  --build-arg PROGRAM_NAME=go-tracepoint-counter \
  --build-arg BPF_FUNCTION_NAME=tracepoint_kill_recorder \
  --build-arg PROGRAM_TYPE=tracepoint \
  --build-arg BYTECODE_FILENAME=bpf_bpfel.o \
  --build-arg KERNEL_COMPILE_VER=$(uname -r) \
  -f ../../packaging/container-deployment/Containerfile.bytecode . -t quay.io/$USER/go-tracepoint-counter-bytecode:latest
```

`bpfd` currently does not provide a method for pre-loading bytecode images
(see [issue #603](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/issues/603)), so push the bytecode image to a remote
repository.
For example:

```console
docker login quay.io
docker push quay.io/$USER/go-xdp-counter-bytecode:latest
docker push quay.io/$USER/go-tc-counter-bytecode:latest
```

Then run with the privately built bytecode container image:

```console
./go-tc-counter -iface ens3 -direction ingress -location image://quay.io/$USER/go-tc-counter-bytecode:latest
2022/12/02 16:38:44 Unable to read /etc/bpfd/bpfd.toml, using default configuration values.
2022/12/02 16:38:44 Using Input: Interface=ens3 Priority=50 Source=quay.io/$USER/go-tc-counter-bytecode:latest

2022/12/02 16:38:51 4 packets received
2022/12/02 16:38:51 580 bytes received

^C2022/12/02 16:38:51 Exiting...
2022/12/02 16:38:51 Unloading Program: 6225
```

#### Preloading eBPF Bytecode

Another way to load the eBPF bytecode is to pre-load the eBPF bytecode and
pass the associated `bpfd` program id to the userspace program.
This is similar to how eBPF programs will be loaded in Kubernetes, except `kubectl` commands will be
used to create Kubernetes CRD objects instead of using `bpfctl`, but that is covered in the next section.
The userspace programs will skip the loading portion and use the program id to find the shared
map and continue from there.

Referring back to the diagram above, the `load` and `unload` are being done by `bpfctl` and not
`go-xdp-counter` userspace program.

First, use `bpfctl` to load the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode:

```console
bpfctl load-from-image --image-url quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-xdp-counter:latest xdp --iface ens3 --priority 50

```

Then run the `go-xdp-counter` userspace program, passing in the UUID:

```console
./go-xdp-counter -iface ens3 -id 6229
2022/12/02 17:01:38 Using Input: Interface=ens3 Source=6229
2022/12/02 17:01:41 180 packets received
2022/12/02 17:01:41 26100 bytes received

2022/12/02 17:01:44 184 packets received
2022/12/02 17:01:44 26680 bytes received

^C2022/12/02 17:01:46 Exiting...
2022/12/02 17:01:46 Closing Connection for Program: 6229
```

Then use `bpfctl` to unload the eBPF bytecode:

```console
bpfctl unload 6229
```
