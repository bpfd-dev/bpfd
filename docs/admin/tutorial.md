# Tutorial

This tutorial will show you how to use `bpfd`.
There are several ways to launch and interact with `bpfd` and `bpfctl`:

* **Privileged Mode** - Run `bpfd` in foreground or background and straight from build directory.
  No `bpfd` or `bpfctl` users are created so always need `sudo` when executing `bpfctl` commands.
  See [Priviledged Mode](#privileged-mode).
* **Unprivileged Mode** - Run `bpfd` in foreground or background and straight from
  build directory, but also create the `bpfd` or `bpfctl` users and the  `bpfd` user group.
  So if `bpfd` user group is added to a given user, `sudo` is no longer needed when executing `bpfctl` commands.
  See [Unpriviledged Mode](#unprivileged-mode).
* **Systemd Service** - Run `bpfd` as a systemd service.
  See [Systemd Service](#systemd-service).

## Privileged Mode

### Step 0: Prerequisites

This tutorial uses examples from the [xdp-tutorial](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial).
You will need to check out the git repository and compile the examples.

### Step 1: Build `bpfd`

Perform the following steps to build `bpfd`.

```console
cd $HOME/src/bpfd/
cargo xtask build-ebpf --libbpf-dir $HOME/src/libbpf
cargo build
```

### Step 2: Setup `bpfd` environment

`bpfd` uses mTLS for mutual authentication with clients.
In order to run and interact with `bpfd`, certificates must be created.
Scripts to create a local certificate authority which is used to sign certs for `bpfd` and `bpfctl`
can be used in a development environment.
Run the following command to create the default directories in `/etc/`, copy over default
configuration files (see [configuration.md](../configuration.md) for details on how to tailor
configuration files), and create the certificates:

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh certs
```

### Step 3: Start `bpfd`

While learning and experimenting with `bpfd`, it may be useful to run `bpfd` in the foreground
(which requires a second terminal to run the `bpfctl` commands below). For more details on
how logging is handled in bpfd, see [Logging](#logging) below.

```console
sudo RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/bpfd
```


Later, once familiar with bpfd, optionally run in the background instead:
```console
sudo bpfd&
```

### Step 4: Load your first program

We will load the simple `xdp-pass` program, which permits all traffic to the interface eth0.
The section in the object file that contains the program is "xdp".
Finally, we will use the priority of 100 (valid values are from 0 to 255).

```console
sudo bpfctl load -p xdp -i eth0 -s "xdp" --priority 100 /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
92e3e14c-0400-4a20-be2d-f701af21873c
```

`bpfctl` returns a unique identifier to the program that was loaded.
This may be used to detach the program later.
We can check the program was loaded using the following command:

```console
sudo bpfctl list -i eth0
wlp2s0
xdp_mode: skb

0: 92e3e14c-0400-4a20-be2d-f701af21873c
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 100
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
```

From the output above you can see the program was loaded to slot 0 on our interface and will be executed first.


### Step 5: Loading more programs

We will now load 2 more programs with different priorities to demonstrate how bpfd will ensure they are ordered correctly:

```console
sudo bpfctl load -p xdp -i eth0 -s "xdp" --priority 50 /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
1ccc1376-60e8-4dc5-9079-6c32748fa1c4
```

```console
sudo bpfctl load -p xdp -i eth0 -s "xdp" --priority 200 /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
6af7c28f-6a7f-46ee-bc98-2d92ed261369
```

Using `bpfctl list` we can see that the programs are correctly ordered.
The lowest priority program is executed first, while the highest is executed last.

```console
sudo bpfctl list -i eth0
eth0
xdp_mode: skb

0: 1ccc1376-60e8-4dc5-9079-6c32748fa1c4
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 50
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
1: 92e3e14c-0400-4a20-be2d-f701af21873c
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 100
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
2: 6af7c28f-6a7f-46ee-bc98-2d92ed261369
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 200
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
```

By default, the next program in the chain will only be executed if a given program returns
`pass` (see `proceed-on` field in the `bpfctl list` output above).
If the next program in the chain should be called even if a different value is returned,
then the program can be loaded with those additional return values using the `proceed-on`
parameter (see `bpfctl help load` for list of valid values):

```console
sudo bpfctl load -p xdp -i eth0 -s "xdp" --proceed-on "drop" --proceed-on "pass" --proceed-on "dispatcher_return" --priority 150 /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
b2f19b7b-4c71-4338-873e-914bd8fa44ba
```

Which results in (see slot 2):

```console
sudo bpfctl list -i eth0
eth0
xdp_mode: skb

0: 1ccc1376-60e8-4dc5-9079-6c32748fa1c4
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 50
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
1: 92e3e14c-0400-4a20-be2d-f701af21873c
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 100
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
2: b2f19b7b-4c71-4338-873e-914bd8fa44ba
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 150
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: drop, pass, dispatcher_return
3: 6af7c28f-6a7f-46ee-bc98-2d92ed261369
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 200
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass", dispatcher_return
```

### Step 6: Delete a program

Let's remove the program at slot 1.

```console
sudo bpfctl unload -i eth0 92e3e14c-0400-4a20-be2d-f701af21873c
```

And we can verify that it has been removed and the other programs re-ordered:

```console
sudo bpfctl list -i eth0
eth0
xdp_mode: skb

0: 1ccc1376-60e8-4dc5-9079-6c32748fa1c4
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 50
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
1: b2f19b7b-4c71-4338-873e-914bd8fa44ba
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 150
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: drop, pass, dispatcher_return
2: 6af7c28f-6a7f-46ee-bc98-2d92ed261369
        name: "xdp"
        priority: 200
        path: /home/dave/dev/xdp-tutorial/basic01-xdp-pass/xdp_pass_kern.o
        proceed-on: pass, dispatcher_return
```

When `bpfd` is stopped, all remaining programs will be unloaded automatically.

### Step 7: Clean-up

To unwind all the changes, stop `bpfd` and then run the following script:

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh del
```

**WARNING:** `setup.sh del` and `setup.sh uninstall` cleans everything up, so `/etc/bpfd/programs.d/`
and `/var/bpfd/bytecode/` are deleted. Save any changes or files that were created if needed.

## Unprivileged Mode

When the mTLS certificates are created, they are created in `/etc/bpfd/certs/` and
`/etc/bpfclt/certs/` directories, which require `sudo` to access.
In order to run `bpfctl` without `sudo`, a `bpfd` and `bpfctl` user and a `bpfd` user group
can be created and made owners of their respective directories.

### Step 0-1

Same as above.

### Step 2: Setup `bpfd` environment

Run the following command to create the desired users and user groups, and make them owners of their
respective directories (this command runs the same steps as the previous `setup.sh` command plus some
additional steps, so run it in-place of `setup.sh certs`):

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh init
```

Then add usergroup `bpfd` to desired user and logout/login to apply:

```console
sudo usermod -a -G bpfd \$USER
exit
<LOGIN>
```

### Step 3-7

Same as above except `sudo` can be dropped from all the `bpfctl` commands.


## Systemd Service

To run `bpfd` as a systemd service, the binaries will be placed in a well known location
(`/usr/sbin/.`) and a service configuration file will be added
(`/usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfd.service`).

### Step 0-1

Same as above.

### Step 2: Setup `bpfd` environment

Run the following command to copy the `bpfd` and `bpfctl` binaries to `/usr/sbin/.` and set the user
and user group for each, and copy a default `bpfd.service` file to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`,
(this command runs the same steps as the previous `setup.sh` commands plus some additional steps,
so run it in-place of  `setup.sh certs` or `setup.sh init`):

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh install
```

Then add usergroup `bpfd` to desired user if not already run and logout/login to apply:
```console
sudo usermod -a -G bpfd \$USER
exit
<LOGIN>
```

To update the configuration settings associated with running `bpfd` as a service, edit the
service configuration file:

```console
sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfd.service
```

If `bpfd` or `bpfctl` is rebuilt, the following command can be run to install the update binaries
without tearing down the users and regenerating the certifications.
The `bpfd` service will is automatically restarted, so installed programs will need to be loaded again.

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh reinstall
```

### Step 3: Start `bpfd`

To manage `bpfd` as a systemd service, use `systemctl`:

```console
sudo systemctl start bpfd.service
...
sudo systemctl stop bpfd.service
```

### Step 4-6

Same as above except `sudo` can be dropped from all the `bpfctl` commands.

### Step 7: Clean-up

To unwind all the changes performed while running `bpfd` as a systemd service, run the following
script (this command cleans up everything, including stopping the `bpfd` service if it is still
running, so run it in-place of `setup.sh del`):

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh uninstall
```

**WARNING:** `setup.sh del` and `setup.sh uninstall` cleans everything up, so `/etc/bpfd/programs.d/`
and `/var/bpfd/bytecode/` are deleted. Save any changes or files that were created if needed.

## Additional Command

A few additional commands are supported in the `setup.sh` script.

### Regenerate Certificates

If the mTLS certificates expired, or just need to be regenerated, run the following command:

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh regen
```

`bpfd` will need to be restarted if the certificates are regenerated.

### gocounter Certificates

This repository contains a sample BFP program written in Go (see [go.md](../developer/go.md)).
This program requires certificates in order to run as well.
To generate certificates for the `gocounter` example, run:

```console
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh gocounter
```


# Logging

## env_logger

`bpfd` and `bpfctl` use the [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger) crate to log messages to the terminal.
By default, only `error` messages are logged, but that can be overwritten by setting
the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
Valid values:
* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `debug`
* `trace`

Example:

```console
$ sudo RUST_LOG=info /usr/local/bin/bpfd
[2022-08-08T20:29:31Z INFO  bpfd] Log using env_logger
[2022-08-08T20:29:31Z INFO  bpfd::server] Loading static programs from /etc/bpfd/programs.d
[2022-08-08T20:29:31Z INFO  bpfd::server::bpf] Map veth12fa8e3 to 13
[2022-08-08T20:29:31Z INFO  bpfd::server] Listening on [::1]:50051
[2022-08-08T20:29:31Z INFO  bpfd::server::bpf] Program added: 1 programs attached to veth12fa8e3
[2022-08-08T20:29:31Z INFO  bpfd::server] Loaded static program pass with UUID d9fd88df-d039-4e64-9f63-19f3e08915ce
```

`bpfctl` doesn't currently have any logs, but the infrastructure is in place if needed for future debugging.

## Systemd Service

If `bpfd` is running as a systemd service, then `bpfd` will log to journald.
As with env_logger, by default, only `error` messages are logged, but that can be
overwritten by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
`bpfctl` won't be run as a service, so it always uses env_logger.

Example:

```console
sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfd.service
[Unit]
Description=Run bpfd as a service
DefaultDependencies=no
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment="RUST_LOG=Info"    <==== Set Log Level Here
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/bpfd
MemoryAccounting=true
MemoryLow=infinity
MemoryMax=infinity

AmbientCapabilities=CAP_BPF CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_PERFMON CAP_SYS_ADMIN CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_BPF CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_PERFMON CAP_SYS_ADMIN CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
```

Start the service:

```console
sudo systemctl start bpfd.service
```

Check the logs:

```console
$ sudo journalctl -f -u bpfd
Aug 08 16:25:04 ebpf03 systemd[1]: Started bpfd.service - Run bpfd as a service.

```

Stop the service:

```console
sudo systemctl stop bpfd.service
```
