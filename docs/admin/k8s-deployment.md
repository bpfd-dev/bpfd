# How to Deploy bpfd on Kubernetes

One of the key use cases for bpfd is to support the deployment of BPF programs
in Kubernetes clusters.  The simplest way to do this is to use the
bpfd-operator.  In this document, we provide an overview of using the
bpfd-operator as well as the manual steps required to use bpfd with Kubernetes,
in general, and OpenShift, in particular.

## bpfd-operator Overview

The Bpfd-Operator can be used to deploy and manage bpfd within a Kubernetes cluster.

The [bpfd-operator
repository](https://github.com/redhat-et/bpfd/tree/main/bpfd-operator) houses
two main processes, the `bpfd-agent` and the `bpfd-operator` along with CRD api
definitions for `BpfProgram` and `BpfProgramConfig` Objects. In the below
sections we'll dive a bit deeper into the API and functionality of both
processes.

## Deployment Options

Choose one of the install options described below, and then go to [Verify the
installation](#verify-the-installation) below to make sure it worked.

### Quick Start with kind and the bpfd-operator

Using kind with the bpfd-operator is an easy way to spin up a local kind cluster
and deploy bpfd.

#### Pre-requsites

- Install `git`, `make`, and `go`
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your platform.
  - We also recommend that you follow the [Post-installation steps for
    Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to allow
    your user to run Docker commands without root priviledges.
- Install [kubctl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) and
  [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
  - [Installation Instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- clone the bpfd repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/bpfd.git
cd bpfd/bpfd-operator
```

The bpfd-operator was built utilizing some great tooling provided by the
[operator-sdk library](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/). A great first step in
understanding some of the functionality can be to cd into the
`bpfd/bpfd-operator` directory and run `make help`.

#### Deploy locally via KIND

After reviewing the possible make targets it's quick and easy to get bpfd
deployed locally on your system via a [KIND cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
with:

```bash
make run-on-kind
```

> **_NOTE:_**  You will need a spare 20G in your root partition to run `make
> run-on-kind`, and it will take a while the first time you run it.

By default local image builds will be used for the kind deployment, however, the
container images used for `bpfd`,`bpfd-agent`, and `bpfd-operator` can also be
configured as follows.

```bash
BPFD_IMG=<your/image/url> BPFD_AGENT_IMG=<your/image/url> BPFD_OPERATOR_IMG=<your/image/url> make run-on-kind
```

To push and test out any local changes simply run:

```bash
make kind-reload-images
```

To tear down the kind cluster, run:
```bash
kind delete cluster -n bpfd-deployment
```

The default name of the created cluster is `bpfd-deployment`.
To retrieve all the created kind clusters, use 
```bash
kind get clusters
```

### Deploy To Openshift Cluster

First install cert-manager (if not already deployed) to the cluster with:

```bash
make deploy-cert-manager
```

Then deploy the operator with one of the following two options:

#### 1. Manually with Kustomize

Then to install manually with Kustomize and raw manifests simply run:

```bash
make deploy-openshift
```

Which can then be cleaned up with:

```bash
make undeploy-openshift
```

#### 2. Via the OLM bundle

The bpfd-operator can also be installed via it's [OLM
bundle](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/deploying-operators-olm-bundles).

First setup the namespace and certificates for the operator with:

```bash
oc apply -f ./hack/ocp-scc-hacks.yaml
```

Then use `operator-sdk` to install the bundle like so:

```bash
operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/bpfd/bpfd-operator-bundle:latest --namespace openshift-bpfd
```

To clean everything up run:

```bash
operator-sdk cleanup bpfd-operator
```

followed by

```bash
oc delete -f ./hack/ocp-scc-hacks.yaml
```

## Verify the installation

> **_NOTE:_**  The commands in this section were run on a local kind deployment.

If the bpfd-operator came up successfully you will see the bpfd-daemon and
bpfd-operator pods running without errors:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n bpfd
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bpfd-daemon-6d4qm                2/2     Running   0          75m
bpfd-daemon-929tf                2/2     Running   0          75m
bpfd-daemon-ftpwn                2/2     Running   0          75m
bpfd-operator-685db895b7-9qqrs   2/2     Running   0          75m
```

To test the deployment, load one or both of the example programs.

> **_NOTE:_**  The example `BpfProgramConfig` CRDs assume that the programs will
> be run on `eth0`, which is the default for the kind deployment.  If you need
> to run the programs on a different interface, modify `interface` in the
> associated file:
>
>- `examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml`,
>  or
>- `examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml`

Load the example xdp kernel and user space programs:

```bash
kubectl create -f examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml
kubectl create -f examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter.yaml
```

Load the example tc kernel and user space programs:

```bash
kubectl create -f examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml
kubectl create -f examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter.yaml
```

Verify that they are loaded:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A 
NAMESPACE            NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
:
go-tc-counter        go-tc-counter-ds-8rgfz                                  1/1     Running   0          13m
go-tc-counter        go-tc-counter-ds-gfn8p                                  1/1     Running   0          13m
go-tc-counter        go-tc-counter-ds-x6vkw                                  1/1     Running   0          13m
go-xdp-counter       go-xdp-counter-ds-6px5b                                 1/1     Running   0          13m
go-xdp-counter       go-xdp-counter-ds-ngbj2                                 1/1     Running   0          13m
go-xdp-counter       go-xdp-counter-ds-rhkd4                                 1/1     Running   0          13m
:
```

You can look at the `status` field in the `bpfprogramconfig` to confirm that the
program has been loaded successfully:

```bash
kubectl get bpfprogramconfig 
NAME                     AGE
go-tc-counter-example    19m
go-xdp-counter-example   19m

kubectl get bpfprogramconfig go-xdp-counter-example -o yaml
apiVersion: bpfd.io/v1alpha1
kind: BpfProgramConfig

    message: bpfProgramReconciliation Succeeded on all nodes
    reason: ReconcileSuccess
    status: "True"
    type: ReconcileSuccess
```

Both of these programs print statistics to their logs, which can be viewed as follows:

```bash
kubectl logs -n go-xdp-counter go-xdp-counter-ds-6px5b
2023/01/12 17:34:37 mapPath=/run/bpfd/fs/maps/56c8f178-4de2-4012-bec3-6d9abe29e195/xdp_stats_map

## API Types Overview

### BpfProgramConfig

The `BpfProgramConfig` CRD is the bpfd K8s API object most relevant to users and
can be used to understand clusterwide state for a BPF program. It's designed
to express how, and where BPF programs are to be deployed within a Kubernetes
cluster.  An example BpfProgramConfig which loads a basic `xdp-pass` program to
all nodes can be seen below:

>**NOTE: Currently the bpfprogram's bytecode section-name MUST match the
>`spec.name` field in the BpfProgramConfig Object.**

```yaml
apiVersion: bpfd.io/v1alpha1
kind: BpfProgramConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: BpfProgramConfig
  name: xdp-pass-all-nodes
spec:
  ## Must correspond to image section name
  name: pass
  type: XDP
  # Select all nodes
  nodeselector: {}
  priority: 0
  attachpoint: 
    interface: eth0
  bytecode:
    imageurl: quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/xdp_pass:latest
```

### BpfProgram

The `BpfProgram` CRD is used internally by the bpfd-deployment to keep track of
per node bpfd state such as program UUIDs and map pin points, and to report node
specific errors back to the user. K8s users/controllers are only allowed to view
these objects, NOT create or edit them.  Below is an example BpfProgram Object
which was automatically generated in response to the above BpfProgramConfig
Object.

```yaml
apiVersion: bpfd.io/v1alpha1
  kind: BpfProgram
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2022-12-07T22:41:29Z"
    finalizers:
    - bpfd.io.agent/finalizer
    generation: 2
    labels:
      owningConfig: xdp-pass-all-nodes
    name: xdp-pass-all-nodes-bpfd-deployment-worker2
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: bpfd.io/v1alpha1
      blockOwnerDeletion: true
      controller: true
      kind: BpfProgramConfig
      name: xdp-pass-all-nodes
      uid: 6e3f5851-97b1-4772-906b-3ac69c6a4057
    resourceVersion: "1506"
    uid: 384d3d5c-e62b-4be3-9bf0-c6cf0e315acf
  spec:
    programs:
      bdeac6d3-4128-464e-9161-6010684eca27:
        attachpoint:
          interface: eth0
        maps: {}
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2022-12-07T22:41:30Z"
      message: Successfully loaded BpfProgram
      reason: bpfdLoaded
      status: "True"
      type: Loaded
```

Applications wishing to use bpfd to deploy/manage their BPF programs in
Kubernetes will make use of this object to find references to the bpfMap pin
points (`spec.maps`) in order to configure their BPF programs.

## Controllers

The Bpfd-Operator performs a few major functions and houses two major
controllers the `bpfd-agent` and `bpfd-operator`.

### bpfd-agent

The bpfd-agent controller is deployed alongside bpfd in a daemonset.  It's main
purpose is to watch user intent (in BpfProgramConfig Objects) and communicate
with bpfd via a mTLS secured connection in order to translate the cluster-wide
user-intent to per node state.

### bpfd-operator

The bpfd-operator performs the following functionality:

- Create and Reconcile the bpfd daemonset (including both the `bpfd` and
  `bpfd-agent` processes) so that no manual edits can be completed.
- Report cluster wide state back the the user with each BpfProgramConfig's
  status field.

## More useful commands

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your bpfd-agent and bpd-operator container images to the
   location specified by `BPFD_AGENT_IMG` and `BPFD_OPERATOR_IMG`:

```bash
make build-images push-images BPFD_OPERATOR_IMG=<some-registry>/bpfd-operator:tag BPFD_AGENT_IMAGE=<some-registry>/bpfd-agent:tag
```

3. Deploy the operator and agent to a cluster with the image specified by
   `BPFD_AGENT_IMG` and `BPFD_OPERATOR_IMG`:

```bash
make deploy BPFD_OPERATOR_IMG=<some-registry>/bpfd-operator:tag BPFD_AGENT_IMAGE=<some-registry>/bpfd-agent:tag
```

## Reinstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```bash
make uninstall
```

## Deploy controller

Deploy bpfd-operator to the K8s cluster specified in ~/.kube/config:

```bash
make deploy
```

## Undeploy controller

Undeploy the controller from a vanilla K8s Deployment cluster:

```bash
make undeploy
```

## Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```bash
make manifests
```
