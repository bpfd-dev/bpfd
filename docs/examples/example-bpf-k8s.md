# Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Kubernetes

This section will describe loading bytecode on a Kubernetes cluster and launching the userspace
program.
The approach is slightly different when running on a Kubernetes cluster.
The eBPF bytecode should be loaded by an administrator, not the userspace program itself.

This section assumes there is already a Kubernetes cluster running and `bpfd` is running in the cluster.
See [How to Manually Deploy bpfd on Kubernetes](./k8s-deployment.md) for details on deploying
bpfd on a Kubernetes cluster, but the quickest solution is to run a Kubernetes KIND Cluster:

```console
cd bpfd/bpfd-operator/
make run-on-kind
```

### Loading eBPF Bytecode On Kubernetes

![go-xdp-counter On Kubernetes](./img/gocounter-on-k8s.png)

Instead of using the userspace program or `bpfctl` to load the eBPF bytecode as done in previous sections,
the bytecode will be loaded by creating a Kubernetes CRD object.
There is a CRD object for each eBPF program type bpfd supports.
Edit the sample yaml files to customize any configuration values:

* TcProgram CRD: [go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml)
* TracepointProgram CRD: [go-tracepoint-counter-bytecode.yaml](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tracepoint-counter-bytecode.yaml)
* XdpProgram CRD: [go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml)

Sample bytecode yaml with XdpProgram CRD:
```console
    vi examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml
    apiVersion: bpfd.io/v1alpha1
    kind: XdpProgram
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: xdpprogram
      name: go-xdp-counter-example
    spec:
      sectionname: stats
      # Select all nodes
      nodeselector: {}
      interfaceselector:
        primarynodeinterface: true
      priority: 55
      bytecode:
        image:
          url: quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go-xdp-counter:latest
```

Note that all the sample yaml files are configured with the bytecode running on all nodes
(`nodeselector: {}`).
This can be change to run on specific nodes, but the DaemonSet yaml for the userspace program, which
is described below, should have an equivalent change.
Make any changes to the `go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml`, then repeat for `go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml`
and `go-tracepoint-counter-bytecode.yaml` and then apply the updated yamls:

```console
    kubectl apply -f examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml
     xdpprogram.bpfd.io/go-xdp-counter-example created

    kubectl apply -f examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml
     tcprogram.bpfd.io/go-tc-counter-example created

    kubectl apply -f examples/go-tracepoint-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tracepoint-counter-bytecode.yaml
     tracepointprogram.bpfd.io/go-tracepoint-counter-example created
```

Following the diagram for XDP example (Blue numbers):

1. The user creates a `XdpProgram` object with the parameters
associated with the eBPF bytecode, like interface, priority and BFP bytecode image.
The name of the `XdpProgram` object in this example is `go-xdp-counter-example`.
2. `bpfd-agent`, running on each node, is watching for all changes to `XdpProgram` objects.
When it sees a `XdpProgram` object created or modified, it makes sure a `BpfProgram` object for that
node exists.
The name of the `BpfProgram` object is the `XdpProgram` object name with the node name appended.
3. `bpfd-agent` then determines if it should be running on the given node, loads or unloads as needed
by making gRPC calls the `bpfd`.
`bpfd` behaves the same as described in the running locally example.
4. `bpfd-agent` finally updates the status of the `BpfProgram` object.
5. `bpfd-operator` watches all `BpfProgram` objects, and updates the status of the `XdpProgram`
object indicating if the eBPF program has been applied to all the desired nodes or not.

To retrieve information on the `XdpProgram` objects:

```console
    kubectl get xdpprograms
    NAME                     PRIORITY   DIRECTION

### Loading Userspace Container On Kubernetes

#### Loading A Userspace Container Image

The userspace programs have been pre-built and can be found here:

* `quay.io/bpfd-userspace/go-tc-counter:latest`
* `quay.io/bpfd-userspace/go-tracepoint-counter:latest`
* `quay.io/bpfd-userspace/go-xdp-counter:latest`

The example yaml files below are loading from these image.

* [go-tc-counter.yaml](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter.yaml)
* [go-tracepoint-counter.yaml](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tracepoint-counter.yaml)
* [go-xdp-counter.yaml](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter.yaml)

The userspace program in a Kubernetes Deployment no longer interacts directly with `bpfd`.
Instead, the userspace program running on each node reads the `BpfProgram` to determine the
map location.
For example, the output above shows the maps as:

```console
    kubectl get bpfprograms go-xdp-counter-example-bpfd-deployment-worker -o yaml
    :
    spec:
      node: bpfd-deployment-worker
      programs:
        ff121084-1211-4fa4-bb16-ddd18e3c63d5:
          xdp_stats_map: /run/bpfd/fs/maps/ff121084-1211-4fa4-bb16-ddd18e3c63d5/xdp_stats_map
      type: xdp
    :
```

To interact with the KubeApiServer, RBAC must be setup properly to access the `BpfProgram`
object.
The `bpfd-operator` defined the yaml for several ClusterRoles that can be used to access the
different `bpfd` related CRD objects with different access rights.
The example userspace containers will use the `bpfprogram-viewer-role`, which allows Read-Only
access to the `BpfProgram` object.
This ClusterRole is created automatically by the `bpfd-operator`.

The remaining objects (NameSpace, ServiceAccount, ClusterRoleBinding and examples DaemonSet)
also need to be created.

```console
    cd bpfd/
    kubectl create -f examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter.yaml
    kubectl create -f examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter.yaml
    kubectl create -f examples/go-tracepoint-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tracepoint-counter.yaml
```

Following the diagram for the XDP example (Green numbers):

1. The userspace program queries the KubeApiServer for a specific `BpfProgram` object.
2. The userspace program pulls the file location of the shared map out of the `BpfProgram`
object and uses the file to periodically read the counter values.

To see if the userspace programs are working, view the logs:

```console
    kubectl get pods -A
    NAMESPACE               NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

    :

To cleanup:

```console
    kubectl delete -f examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter.yaml
    kubectl delete -f examples/go-xdp-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-xdp-counter-bytecode.yaml

    kubectl delete -f examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter.yaml
    kubectl delete -f examples/go-tc-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tc-counter-bytecode.yaml

    kubectl delete -f examples/go-tracepoint-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tracepoint-counter.yaml
    kubectl delete -f examples/go-tracepoint-counter/kubernetes-deployment/go-tracepoint-counter-bytecode.yaml
```

There are two scripts that will automate the steps described above:

```console
    cd bpfd
    ./scripts/cr-k8s-examples.sh
    xdpprogram.bpfd.io/go-xdp-counter-example created
    namespace/go-xdp-counter created

#### Building A Userspace Container Image

To build the userspace examples in a container instead of using the pre-built ones,
from the bpfd code source directory, run the following build commands:

```console
    cd bpfd/
    docker build -f examples/go-xdp-counter/container-deployment/Containerfile.go-xdp-counter . -t quay.io/$USER/go-xdp-counter:latest
    docker build -f examples/go-tc-counter/container-deployment/Containerfile.go-tc-counter . -t quay.io/$USER/go-tc-counter:latest
    docker build -f examples/go-tracepoint-counter/container-deployment/Containerfile.go-tracepoint-counter . -t quay.io/$USER/go-tracepoint-counter:latest
```

Then push images to a remote repository:

```console
    docker login quay.io
    docker push quay.io/$USER/go-xdp-counter:latest
    docker push quay.io/$USER/go-tc-counter:latest
    docker push quay.io/$USER/go-tracepoint-counter:latest
```

Update the yaml to use the private images.
