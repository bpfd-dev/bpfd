# Example eBPF Programs

Example applications that use the `bpfd-go` bindings can be found in the
[examples/](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/) directory.
Current examples include:

* [examples/go-tc-counter/](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tc-counter)
* [examples/go-tracepoint-counter/](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tracepoint-counter)
* [examples/go-xdp-counter/](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-xdp-counter)

These examples and the associated documentation is intended to provide the basics on how to deploy
and manage a eBPF program using bpfd. Each of the examples contain an eBPF Program written in C
([tc_counter.c](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tc-counter/bpf/tc_counter.c),
[tracepoint_counter.c](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-tracepoint-counter/bpf/tracepoint_counter.c) and
[xdp_counter.c](https://github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/tree/main/examples/go-xdp-counter/bpf/xdp_counter.c))
that is compiled into eBPF bytecode.
Each time the eBPF program is called, it increments the packet and byte counts in a map that is accessible
by the userspace portion.

Each of the examples also have a userspace portion written in GO.
When run locally, the userspace program makes gRPC calls to `bpfd` requesting `bpfd` to load the eBPF program
at the requested hook point (XDP hook point, TC hook point or Tracepoint).
When run in a Kubernetes deployment, the `bpfd-agent` makes gRPC calls to `bpfd` requesting `bpfd` to load
the eBPF program based on a Custom Resource Definition (CRD), which is described in more detail in that section.
Independent of the deployment, the userspace program then polls the eBPF map every 3 seconds and logs the
current counts.
The userspace code is leveraging the [cilium/ebpf library](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf)
to manage the maps shared with the eBPF program.
The example eBPF programs are very similar in functionality, and only vary where in the Linux networking stack
they are inserted.
Read more about XDP and TC programs [here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/bpf/progtypes/).

There are two ways to deploy these example applications:

* Run locally on one machine: [Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Local Host](./example-ebpf-local.md)
* Deploy to multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster: [Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Kubernetes](./example-ebpf-k8s.md)
