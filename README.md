## Welcome to bpfd

bpfd is a system daemon aimed at simplifying the deployment and management of eBPF programs.
It's goal is to enhance the developer-experience as well as provide features to improve security,
visibility and program-cooperation.
bpfd includes a Kubernetes operator to bring those same features to Kubernetes, allowing users to
safely deploy eBPF via custom resources across nodes in a cluster.
