bpfd
====

A work in progress implementation of the xdp_multiprog protocol in Rust, using Aya.
It differs from the implementation in libxdp as we have chosen to implement a daemon instead.

- bpfd is the daemon
- bpfctl is the client program

There is a gRPC API that connects the two

## Requirements

- Rust Stable & Rust Nightly
- [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker)
- protoc
- LLVM 11 or later
- ... and make sure the submodules are checked out

## Building

```
$ cargo xtask build-ebpf --release
$ cargo build
```

## Usage

Load a sample XDP Program:
```
$ cargo build
$ sudo ./target/debug/bpfd&
$ ./target/debug/bpfctl load /path/to/xdp/program -p xdp -i wlp2s0 --priority 50 -s "pass"
```
