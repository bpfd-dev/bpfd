# Synopsis of the Script
#
# This script sets up an environment for cross-compiling Rust projects
# targeting multiple architectures, including `amd64`, `aarch64`,
# `ppc64le`, and `s390x`. It handles the installation of the
# appropriate toolchains, system libraries, and Rust targets to enable
# both native and cross-compilation. The script automates tasks, such
# as managing different architecture names across multiple tools and
# packages (Debian, Rust, GCC), ensuring dynamic linking, and
# correctly configuring build settings based on the target
# architecture.
#
# Why We Need Multiple Maps
#
# Different tools and environments use varying conventions to identify
# architectures. To ensure smooth cross-compilation, the script uses
# several maps to translate architecture names and select the correct
# toolchain components. Here's why each map is needed:
#
# 1. Architecture Alias Map (`arch_alias_map`)
#
#    - Purpose: Translates user-friendly or alternative architecture
#      names (e.g., `ppc64le`, `amd64`) into the standard architecture
#      names expected by the system and tools like Debian, Rust, and
#      GCC.
#
#    - Why it's needed: Different tools and environments (such as
#      Debian, Rust, and GCC) often use different names for the same
#      architecture. For example, Rust uses `aarch64` while Debian
#      uses `arm64`. This map ensures that architecture inputs are
#      correctly translated and standardised across the script, making
#      it compatible with the tools in use.
#
# 2. Rust Target Map (`rust_target_map`)
#
#    - Purpose: Maps canonical architectures to Rust's target triple
#      format (e.g., `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`).
#
#    - Why it's needed: Rust requires a specific target triple to
#      build for non-native architectures. This map allows the script
#      to select the correct target based on the architecture.
#
# 3. GCC Toolchain Map (`gcc_toolchain_map`)
#
#    - Purpose: Maps canonical architectures to their corresponding
#      GCC toolchain triplet (e.g., `x86_64-linux-gnu`).
#
#    - Why it's needed: GCC uses different triplet names for cross-
#      compilation toolchains. This map ensures that the correct
#      toolchain is used for each architecture when compiling C code
#      (e.g., using the `cc` linker in Rust builds).
#
# 4. GCC Package Map (`gcc_pkg_toolchain_map`)
#
#    - Purpose: Maps canonical architectures to the names of the
#      corresponding GCC toolchain packages in Debian (e.g., `gcc-
#      x86-64-linux-gnu`).
#
#    - Why it's needed: When setting up the environment, the script
#      needs to install the appropriate GCC toolchain for the target
#      architecture. This map provides the Debian package name for
#      each toolchain.
#
# 5. Debian Architecture Map (`debian_arch_map`)
#
#    - Purpose: Maps canonical architectures to their corresponding
#      Debian architecture name (e.g., `amd64`, `arm64`, `ppc64el`).
#
#    - Why it's needed: When managing libraries and foreign
#      architectures in Debian (such as with `libssl-dev`), the script
#      needs to know the correct architecture name for package
#      management. This map ensures that the proper architecture name
#      is used when installing cross-compiled libraries.
#
# Each map in the script is designed to bridge the gap between
# different naming conventions used by Rust, GCC, and Debian. Without
# these maps, it would be difficult to automate the process of
# selecting the correct toolchain, libraries, and build configuration
# for cross-compilation across multiple architectures. The maps ensure
# consistency and correctness in the complex environment of
# multi-architecture cross-compilation.
#
# Note About OpenSSL
#
# In this script, we ensure that OpenSSL is always dynamically linked,
# and we never build a binary that statically links OpenSSL. Static
# linking of OpenSSL can create potential security risks, as any
# vulnerability in OpenSSL would require rebuilding the binary to
# incorporate the security fix. By dynamically linking OpenSSL, the
# systemâ€™s shared libraries can be updated independently of the
# binary, ensuring that security patches are applied automatically.
#
# To enforce this, we:
#
# 1. Set `OPENSSL_STATIC=0`, which explicitly disables static linking
#    for OpenSSL.
#
# 2. Set `OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR=1` to avoid using a vendored version of
#    OpenSSL that may build statically. This ensures the build uses
#    the system-provided OpenSSL library instead.
#
# 3. Use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-crt-static"` to further ensure
#    that the C runtime and libraries like OpenSSL are dynamically
#    linked.
#
# This guarantees that the resulting binaries are secure and can
# benefit from system-level OpenSSL updates without needing to rebuild
# or redeploy the binary.
